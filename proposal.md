# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Predciting adult's salaries

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A jupyter notebook that helps to determine how much somebody makes in a year based off of job and other fators.
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use various data related packages such as numpy and pandas in order to clean up my data. Then, I will visulaize the data using matplotlib, a graphing library. I will then attempt to use machine leanring packages such as scikit learn to make my prediction.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

All of my data "cleaned" and visulized in an interesting way.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Prediction on income that is somewhat accurate.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Predictions that are accurate and has valid analysis.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In order to complete this project, I will first need to become familiar with jupyter notebook. After that I will understand numpy and pandas. After this, I will start cleaning my data. Once everything is clean I will start learning machine leanring algorithms.
